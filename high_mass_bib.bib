	abstract = {We describe the methodology and novel techniques used to construct a set of waveforms, or template bank, applicable to searches for compact binary coalescences in Advanced LIGO's second observing run. This template bank is suitable for observing systems composed of two neutron stars, two black holes, or a neutron star and a black hole. The Post-Newtonian formulation is used to model waveforms with total mass less than 4  M⊙  and the most recent effective-one-body model, calibrated to numerical relativity to include the merger and ringdown, is used for total masses greater than 4  M⊙ . The effects of spin precession, matter, orbital eccentricity and radiation modes beyond the quadrupole are neglected. In contrast to the template bank used to search for compact binary mergers in Advanced LIGO's first observing run, here we are including binary-black-hole systems with total mass up to several hundreds of solar masses, thereby improving the ability to observe such systems. We introduce a technique to vary the starting frequency of waveform filters so that our bank can simultaneously contain binary-neutron-star and high-mass binary-black hole waveforms. We also introduce a lower-bound on the filter waveform length, to exclude very short-duration, high-mass templates whose sensitivity is strongly reduced by the characteristics and performance of the interferometers.},

	abstract = {'Blip glitches' are a type of short duration transient noise in LIGO data. The cause for the majority of these is currently unknown. Short duration transient noise creates challenges for searches of the highest mass binary black hole systems, as standard methods of applying signal consistency, which look for consistency in the accumulated signal-to-noise of the candidate event, are unable to distinguish many blip glitches from short duration gravitational-wave signals due to similarities in their time and frequency evolution. We demonstrate a straightforward method, employed during Advanced LIGO's second observing run, including the period of joint observation with the Virgo observatory, to separate the majority of this transient noise from potential gravitational-wave sources. This yields a  ~$20\%$  improvement in the detection rate of high mass binary black hole mergers (>$ 60 M_{\odot}$ ) for the PyCBC analysis.},

		Searches for gravitational waves make use of matched filtering, which uses a waveform model to extract signals from data.

		WHICH WAVEFORM MODELS ARE USED IN BANK?

		HOW BANK IS MADE A discrete set of waveform templates is chosen and stored in a template bank such that any potential signal will have high overlap with one of the templates in the bank. This decreases the parameter search space which is continuouis over a wide set of parameters.

		---> benifit of BCR is continuous

		NON GAUSSIAN NOISE If the detector noise were Gaussian, matched filtering alone would be nearly sufficient to find signals within LIGO data, however, the data contains non-Gaussian noise transients which produce large signal-to-noise ratios

		PYCBC SERACH AND RANKING STAT matched filtering + signal consistency (as described by findchirp) + phase-amplitude-time difference consistency

		Candidates compared to background

		Part of the construction of the full ranking statistic, is the signal consistency re-weighted signal-to-noise (loudness of a signal in a single detector)

		introduce a new signal consistency test, which targets a type of noise transient that is not well suppressed by existing methods, known as 'blips' [19]. The mechanism for most instances of this non-Gaussian noise source is not yet well understood. Many instances, however, contain excess power at higher frequencies than expected for the waveform templates that these glitches are mistaken for. We also modify the single detector loudness measure and demonstrate that we are able to achieve  ~$ 20\%$  improvement in the detection rate of binary black holes with masses greater than $60{\rm{-}}100 M_{\odot}$ .

		Match-filter SNR is optimal for extracting signals from gaussian noise: (Maggiore M 2007 Gravitational Waves. Vol. 1: Theory and Experiments (Oxford Master Series in Physics) (Oxford: Oxford University Press)
