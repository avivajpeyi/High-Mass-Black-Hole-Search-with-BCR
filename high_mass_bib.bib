	abstract = {We describe the methodology and novel techniques used to construct a set of waveforms, or template bank, applicable to searches for compact binary coalescences in Advanced LIGO's second observing run. This template bank is suitable for observing systems composed of two neutron stars, two black holes, or a neutron star and a black hole. The Post-Newtonian formulation is used to model waveforms with total mass less than 4  M⊙  and the most recent effective-one-body model, calibrated to numerical relativity to include the merger and ringdown, is used for total masses greater than 4  M⊙ . The effects of spin precession, matter, orbital eccentricity and radiation modes beyond the quadrupole are neglected. In contrast to the template bank used to search for compact binary mergers in Advanced LIGO's first observing run, here we are including binary-black-hole systems with total mass up to several hundreds of solar masses, thereby improving the ability to observe such systems. We introduce a technique to vary the starting frequency of waveform filters so that our bank can simultaneously contain binary-neutron-star and high-mass binary-black hole waveforms. We also introduce a lower-bound on the filter waveform length, to exclude very short-duration, high-mass templates whose sensitivity is strongly reduced by the characteristics and performance of the interferometers.},

	abstract = {'Blip glitches' are a type of short duration transient noise in LIGO data. The cause for the majority of these is currently unknown. Short duration transient noise creates challenges for searches of the highest mass binary black hole systems, as standard methods of applying signal consistency, which look for consistency in the accumulated signal-to-noise of the candidate event, are unable to distinguish many blip glitches from short duration gravitational-wave signals due to similarities in their time and frequency evolution. We demonstrate a straightforward method, employed during Advanced LIGO's second observing run, including the period of joint observation with the Virgo observatory, to separate the majority of this transient noise from potential gravitational-wave sources. This yields a  ~$20\%$  improvement in the detection rate of high mass binary black hole mergers (>$ 60 M_{\odot}$ ) for the PyCBC analysis.},

MBTA runs with a low computational cost, and can identify candidate GW events online with a sub-minute latency. The low computational running cost of MBTA also makes it useful for data quality studies. Events detected by MBTA online can be used to alert astronomical partners for electromagnetic follow-up. We outline the current status of MBTA and give details of recent pipeline upgrades and validation tests that were performed in preparation for the first advanced detector observing period. The MBTA pipeline is ready for the outset of the advanced detector era and the exciting prospects it will bring.}

We outline the merits of and differences between the various quantities used for parameterizing noise curves and characterizing gravitational-wave amplitudes. We conclude by producing plots that consistently compare different detectors. Similar figures can be generated on-line for general use at http://rhcole.com/apps/GWplotter.}
